How rendering works.

Q1. What is React Fiber?
ðŸ‘‰ Answer: Fiber is the reconciliation engine introduced in React 16. It allows React to:
    Break rendering work into small units.
    Pause, resume, or abort work.
    Prioritize updates (high-priority user input vs low-priority rendering).

Q3. What are the phases in React Fiber?
ðŸ‘‰ Answer :
    Render Phase â†’ creates work-in-progress fiber tree (can be paused, async).
    Commit Phase â†’ applies changes to DOM (sync, cannot be interrupted).
