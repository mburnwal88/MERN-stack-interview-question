Q1. Whatâ€™s the difference between local and global state?
ðŸ‘‰ Answer :
    Local State â†’ data needed only within a single component (e.g., input value, toggle, modal open/close). Managed with useState or useReducer.
    Global State â†’ data needed across multiple components (e.g., user auth, theme, cart items). Managed with Context API, Redux, Zustand, etc.
