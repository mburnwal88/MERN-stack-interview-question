Q1. How does React.memo work?
ðŸ‘‰ Answer : 
Wraps a component â†’ prevents re-render unless props change.
const Child = React.memo(({ value }) => {
  console.log("Rendered");
  return <p>{value}</p>;
});

Q2. Difference between useCallback and useMemo?
ðŸ‘‰ Answer :
    useCallback(fn, deps) â†’ memoizes a function reference.
    useMemo(fn, deps) â†’ memoizes the result of a function.

Q3. Example: Preventing child re-renders with useCallback

Q4. When should you avoid React.memo?
ðŸ‘‰ Avoid when component is small and cheap to render â†’ extra comparison may cost more than just re-rendering.
